# Scenes
## PrototypeZero
This is a scene meant to test all the basic interactions that we might need. So:

- Pushing and pulling
- Ink interactions
- Character movement

Probably going to start moving things into a more official scene (i.e., merging with environment test soon.)

## environment test
Set up by Athena, mostly just is a probuilder environment with character controls. To be merged with PrototypeZero.

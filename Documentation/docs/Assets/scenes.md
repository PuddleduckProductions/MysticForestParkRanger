# Scenes
## PrototypeZero
This is a scene meant to test all the basic interactions that we might need. So:

- Pushing and pulling
- Ink interactions
- Character movement

Probably going to start moving things into a more official scene (i.e., merging with environment test soon.)

## environment test
Set up by Athena, mostly just is a probuilder environment with character controls.

## Play Area
This is a template scene for basic character controls and interactions. It can be copied with `CTRL+N` (or `File->New Scene`).

## Camera-Transition
A demo scene meant to demonstrate how multiple virtual cameras can work together.

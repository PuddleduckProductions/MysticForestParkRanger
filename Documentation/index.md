If you're a programmer, you might want to check the API.

For tutorials, check the [Docs](docs/introduction.md).

Feel free to contribute to this repository in the Documentation folder on Github. Markdown files can be added in Documentation/docs. Comments that use XML formatting (i.e., ///&lt;summary&gt;) from within the project will be added.

Refer to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for how to write markdown files.

## Generating Documentation
Documentation is *mostly* autogenerated as soon as you push to master.

The only thing that doesn't update is the API page. Luckily, if you're working on Unity you should already have most of the pre-requisites. First, make sure you have [docfx installed](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started). Then:

### Windows
Run `build.ps1` in `Documentation/docs`.

If you want to preview the docs, you can add `build.ps1 --serve` to run a local server. 

### MacOS/Linux
Run `build.sh` in `Documentation/docs`.

If you want to preview the docs, you can add `build.sh --serve`  to run a local server.

If you experience any bugs, let Tyler know.

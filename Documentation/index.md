# Mystic Forest Park Ranger
Welcome to the documentation for MysticForestParkRanger!

If you're a programmer, you might want to check the [API](/api).

For tutorials, check the [Docs](docs/introduction.md).

Feel free to contribute to this repository in the Documentation folder on Github. Markdown files can be added in Documentation/docs. Comments that use XML formatting (i.e., ///&gt;summary&lt;) from within the project will be added.

Any pushes to master will automatically update the docs on this page. Refer to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for how to write markdown files.

If your documentation isn't showing up, let Tyler know.
